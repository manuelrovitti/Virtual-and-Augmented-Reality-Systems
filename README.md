# Virtual Reality Project
This project is an exam for the Virtual course.
The course was attended without prior knowledge of 3D modeling. Starting from creating simple objects, progressively more complex ones were modeled to then render them or use them in Unity for the creation of an environment.

# First Models
In the first lessons, we covered the basic commands to navigate efficiently through the Blender graphical interface, mainly through the use of shortcuts.

One of the first exercises was the creation of a bench with bushes on the side and a streetlight, with a light inside the streetlight's sphere. In this case, no rounding functions were used.

# Experimenting
As the lessons progressed, we experimented with various types of modeling and rounding, along with the application of different types of lights. We learned to position the different types of lights depending on the desired result. Additionally, we learned how to modify textures to create a specific material, in this case, glass.

# Final Project
The exam consisted of reproducing a room chosen at random from the IKEA website and replicating it in Blender; then exporting it to Unity and making it explorable.

The room to replicate was a kitchen:

Through a series of steps, the result obtained in Unity was this:
